## Usage

### Operating Systems

Since this project uses [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) you can run it on a range of operating systems; Windows, Linux, Mac, etc.

This document will provide details for users of Windows (Docker Desktop) and Linux (Docker CE).



### Windows Requirements

#### WSL 2

To run Docker Desktop on a Windows machine it is recommended that you use the [WSL 2 backend](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/).

Prerequisites:

1. Windows 10, version 1903 or higher or Windows 11.
2. Enable WSL 2 feature on Windows. For detailed instructions, refer to the [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).
3. Download and install the [Linux kernel update package](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/wsl2-kernel).



#### Linux Distribution

[WSL 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux) is the recommended backend for Docker Desktop but it also allows Linux commands to be run natively:

- Useful commands such as find, grep, sed and awk.
- Packages such as git, jq and csvkit.
- Entire shell scripts.

WSL 2 is incredibly useful and brings the power of the Linux command line to Windows.

To gain the full benefits of WSL 2 you will will need to install a Linux distribution on your Windows machine.

The installation can be done via the Microsoft store; Ubuntu is the distribution of choice for this project.



#### Docker Desktop

To run Docker on a Windows machine you need [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop), included in the free subscription plan [Docker Personal](https://www.docker.com/products/personal).

To install Docker Desktop, simply follow the installation [instructions](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/) provided by Docker.



### Ubuntu Requirements

#### Docker CE

To run Docker on a Ubuntu machine you need Docker installed; typically Docker CE (Community Edition).

Simply follow the installation [instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) provided by Docker. Installing using the Docker [repository](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository) is the recommended approach.

Once Docker is installed and the "hello-world" example runs via "sudo", follow the described [steps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) to manage Docker as a non-root user.

Once Docker is installed and can be managed as a non-root user, Ubuntu is ready for the SSE Results application.



### Application Installation

#### Pull the Docker Image

Although Docker will automatically "pull" the required image layers when running the application image it may be preferable to issue a pull command manually.

```shell
$ docker pull logiqx/sse-results
```



#### Clone the Project Repository

You may need to install git:

```shell
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install git-all
```

Clone the project repository to create a local copy:

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:Logiqx/sse-results.git
```

If the git command fails, you may not have set up a password protected SSH key. You may therefore prefer to use HTTPS instead:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/Logiqx/sse-results.git
```

Note: The project repository is pretty small and was approximately 48MB in size on 20 Feb 2022.



### Running the Reports

The test reports using historical WSW data can be generated by running a shell script from within the project root:

```shell
$ cd sse-results
$ bin/results.sh
```

To gain an insight into what occurs during the processing, reading the [diagnostics](diagnostics.md) section is highly recommended.

Note: It usually takes around 10 seconds in total to run all of the WSW reports for 1998 to 2021.
