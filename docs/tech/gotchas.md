## Speed Sailing Event Gotchas

This document describes some of the common pitfalls which may apply during a speed sailing competition.

It is worth event organisers reading these prior to the event itself.



### GPSResults

Checklist for course timings:

- Specify time zone as appropriate in GPSResults (e.g. +1 hour during WSW), prior to entering the course time limits.
- Add 1 minute to the "stop time" because the time filter uses the end times, not the start times.

Checklist for shore courses during events such as Weymouth Speed Week:

- Ensure the correct "track length" option is used; WSW uses a "500m start line" and not the default "500m".
- Ensure the shore course is wide enough for any runs far from the beach to be counted.

Checklist for harbour courses:

- If the start buoys drifted during the session then a good workaround is to use a "500m start line" course.



### Reports

Keep an eye out for the following during the week:

- Session times should be specified within the new daily reporting as well as within GPSResults; belt and braces!
  - If any runs output by GPSResults are rejected by the reporting then the time limits need to be double-checked.
- Queries about missing runs should (hopefully) not be a common occurrence if the GPSResults checklist is followed.
  - e.g. Harbour courses should set as a "500m start line", should the buoys have drifted slightly during the session.
- Queries about surprisingly "slow runs" should not be a common occurrence if the GPSResults checklist is followed.
  - e.g. Thursday of 2021 initially used the default "track length" option of "500m" instead of the "500m start line".
