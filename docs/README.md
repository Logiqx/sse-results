## Speed Sailing Event Results

This project was originally created for past, present and future [results](https://logiqx.github.io/wsw-results/results/index.html) of Weymouth Speed Week.

It is anticipated that it may be used for other speed sailing events as well, hence the creation of a generic project.

Technical project [documentation](tech/README.md) for this [project](https://github.com/Logiqx/sse-results) is available on GitHub pages.
